# Authentication

This guide walks through adding authentication in a few steps.

## 1) Create an app
Explain your setup here (NextAuth, custom JWTs, etc).

## 2) Protect routes
Describe middleware/server checks/guards.

## 3) Persist sessions
Talk about cookies, tokens, or DB-backed sessions.

> Tip: Add code examples specific to your stack here.
